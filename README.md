# Cat Vs Dog Image Classifier 

I was learning about Image Classification and Convulutional Neural Networks so I decided to make this cool project! It's a machine learning model that can nearly rival a 3 year old in classifying whether an animal is a cat or dog.

# Technologies used:

- Tensorflow and Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

# Key Features:

- Extensive Data Preprocessing including normalizing pixel density
- Model Construction and Training: Use of convolutional neural network
- Evaluation of Model using precision, recall and accuracy
